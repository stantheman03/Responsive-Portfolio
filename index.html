				So basically, movie star by day and coder by night. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Like many celebrities, My secret talent is coding. It took me over a year, to discover my talent. I have mastered html , wondering if I should quit acting and become a developer for a fortune 500 company.
			</p>
			<p>
				My favorite activity is playing video games with my wife. I believe this is best way to relax, especially if you are a developer. One day hopefully my coding love will help in making a great video game starring the one only "George Clooney".I tend to to refer myself in third person a lot, its an acting thing.
